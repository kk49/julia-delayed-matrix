## TODO
# * need scaler / parameter types so that a new kernel is not generated for every new 
# host side value of a parameter, the user should decide where the placeholders are used
# * OpenCL is portable and in program buildable but cannot work with Nvidia Cu* libraries (like CuBLAS)
# * PTX is low level and not portable, but is in program buildable and can work with Nvidia libraries
# * de_barrier() or de_barrier(:x,:y) to extract only x & y ?
# * x[] = v (assignment)
# * x = v[] (ref)
# * x[a:s:b] = v (sub view assignment)
# * x[a:b] = v (sub view assignment)
# * x[] = v[a:s:b] (sub view extraction)
# * x[] = v[a:b] (sub view extraction)
# * A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF
